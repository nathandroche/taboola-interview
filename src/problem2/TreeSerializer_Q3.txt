I decided to take the easy way out in order save time. Its actually not that difficult to update
the code in order to account for different data types. The first thing you need to do is update 
the Node class so that it contains a more broad Object variable. This object variable would need to
be restricted to objects that implement the serializable interface. Then, when printing or reading in
the nodes from the serial, you simply need to call their respective serialize methods instead of 
converting from int to string and string to int as was true in this case. For primitive data types,
this would require also using the class wrappers (like Integer) that java has for them.
